# RobloxCookies.dat-deleter
As simple as it sounds, this tool aims to help with instantly deleting the RobloxCookies.dat file.
Which in return removes that annoying "Error 403" that Roblox gives when you're trying to play on an account
whilst being banned on another.

# Usage
Simply open up the file and it should automatically delete the RobloxCookies.dat file, then join a Roblox game.

# Conclusion
just a little app i thought i'd quickly make by learning a tad bit of c++, ofc with the help of some ai
and a lot of document reading, considering i've had enough of roblox being annoying everytime i got banned

you can use it however you like from distributing it on your name, selling it, i really don't care, this didn't take more than 30 mins to make
